# whosopen
Script that allows you to scan for unauthenticated public wifi hotspots and get their IP address. This is a proof of concept script written to help map out public wifi spots and should **not** be used for malicious purposes. It was written out of boredom and curiosity.  

# Using whosopen

whosopen is only avaliable to Linux users, no version for Windows is going to be developed. Your distro must have nmcli and python3 in order for this to work.

To set up and use whosopen, enter the following into the terminal:

1. cd \<replace this with the dir where you downloaded whosopen to\>
2. chmod +x ./whosopen
3. sudo ./whosopen \<optional number frequency argument\>

To stop scanning, press CTRL+C repeatedly until it ends.
